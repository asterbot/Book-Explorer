# CS 348 Project
Our project is built using MySQL for the database, Python for the backend, and React/TypeScript for the frontend.

## Setup instructions

1. Download and setup MySQL from the document on LEARN
2. Create a `.env` file **at the root of the repository** with the following structure:

```
USER=<user>
PWD=<password>
```

Note: `<user>` and `<password>` is the username and password that you used when setting up MySQL.


3. To load the database into mysql, run `mysql -u <user> -p cs348_project < data/books.sql`
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Try going into the `backend` folder running `python backend.py` and see that the first row of the database gets printed to the console. The expected output is:
```
