## Setup instructions

### DB access
The database is hosted on Supabase via PostgresSQL. \
To set up the database, you will first need to create a blank database on Supabase and enter your API credentials in `.env` in the root of the repository. \
It will have the following format:
```.env
user=...
password=...
host=...
port=...
dbname=...
```

Then, set up a virtual environment in the backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

If you want to initialize the database, run `./setup.sh` in the root directory after setting up the virtual environment.
> This is the script that initializes the database schemas and loads sample data into them.

Then you should be able to run any SQL query with `python runSQL.py [name-of-sql-file].sql` and see the output on the terminal.

## Running locally

To run the app locally, do the following after the DB setup has been done:

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate # if you are using a virtual env
python backend.py # use python3 instead if you have an older python version installed
```

This command starts the Flask development server with API endpoints

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Features Implemented

The application supports the following features (linked to SQL queries in `queries/milestone3/`):

### Basic Features
- Search for books by title (R6)
- Add books to a wishlist (R7)
- View common books between two users (R8) 
- View top 5 highest-rated books (R9)
